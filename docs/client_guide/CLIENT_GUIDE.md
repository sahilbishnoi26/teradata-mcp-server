# Working with MCP Clients

![Getting Started](../media/MCP-quickstart.png)

This documet will cover the process and options for getting a client tool to connect to the teradata-mcp-server.  Note that you have many client options, we will cover some but not all.

The transport mode that the server is running needs to be the same as the client configuration.

![Client Server](../media/clientServer.png)

If you configured the server as a Streamable-http transport mode then the client also needs to be configured as a streamable-http mode.

There are many client options that you can choose from, they each have different strengths, we have curated a small number so that you have examples.

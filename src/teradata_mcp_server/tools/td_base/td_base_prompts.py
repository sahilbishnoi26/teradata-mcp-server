   Common Teradata Statements:
   `FROM`: The FROM clause specifies the source of the data for the query. It can include a single table, multiple joined tables, or subqueries. The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins, including INNER, OUTER, CROSS, NATURAL, SEMI, ANTI, LATERAL, POSITIONAL, ASOF, and self-joins., Examples: ['SELECT * FROM table_name;', 'FROM table_name SELECT *;', 'FROM table_name;', 'SELECT tn.* FROM table_name tn;', 'SELECT * FROM schema_name.table_name;', 'SELECT t.i FROM range(100) AS t(i);', "SELECT * FROM 'test.csv';", 'SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM table_name);', 'SELECT t FROM t;', "SELECT t FROM (SELECT unnest(generate_series(41, 43)) AS x, 'hello' AS y) t;", 'SELECT * FROM table_name JOIN other_table ON table_name.key = other_table.key;', 'SELECT * FROM table_name TABLESAMPLE 10%;', 'SELECT * FROM table_name TABLESAMPLE 10 ROWS;', 'FROM range(100) AS t(i) SELECT sum(t.i) WHERE i % 2 = 0;', 'SELECT a.*, b.* FROM a CROSS JOIN b;', 'SELECT a.*, b.* FROM a, b;', 'SELECT n.*, r.* FROM l_nations n JOIN l_regions r ON (n_regionkey = r_regionkey);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport NATURAL JOIN airport_names;', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport JOIN airport_names USING (iata);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport SEMI JOIN airport_names USING (iata);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport WHERE iata IN (SELECT iata FROM airport_names);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport ANTI JOIN airport_names USING (iata);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport WHERE iata NOT IN (SELECT iata FROM airport_names WHERE iata IS NOT NULL);', 'SELECT * FROM range(3) t(i), LATERAL (SELECT i + 1) t2(j);', 'SELECT * FROM generate_series(0, 1) t(i), LATERAL (SELECT i + 10 UNION ALL SELECT i + 100) t2(j);', 'SELECT * FROM trades t ASOF JOIN prices p ON t.symbol = p.symbol AND t.when >= p.when;', 'SELECT * FROM trades t ASOF LEFT JOIN prices p ON t.symbol = p.symbol AND t.when >= p.when;', 'SELECT * FROM trades t ASOF JOIN prices p USING (symbol, "when");', 'SELECT t.symbol, t.when AS trade_when, p.when AS price_when, price FROM trades t ASOF LEFT JOIN prices p USING (symbol, "when");', 'SELECT * FROM t AS t t1 JOIN t t2 USING(x);', 'FROM tbl SELECT i, s;', 'FROM tbl;']
   `SELECT`: The SELECT statement retrieves rows from the database. It is used to query the database and retrieve data according to specific requirements. The statement can include several clauses, such as FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT, to filter, organize, and limit the query results., Examples: ['SELECT * FROM tbl;', 'SELECT j FROM tbl WHERE i = 3;', 'SELECT i, sum(j) FROM tbl GROUP BY i;', 'SELECT * FROM tbl ORDER BY i DESC LIMIT 3;', 'SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (a, b);', 'SELECT #1, #3 FROM tbl;', 'SELECT DISTINCT city FROM addresses;', 'SELECT d FROM (SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS b) d;', 'SELECT rowid, id, content FROM t;']
   `SEL`: The SELECT statement retrieves rows from the database. It is used to query the database and retrieve data according to specific requirements. The statement can include several clauses, such as FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT, to filter, organize, and limit the query results., Examples: ['SEL * FROM tbl;', 'SEL j FROM tbl WHERE i = 3;', 'SEL i, sum(j) FROM tbl GROUP BY i;', 'SEL * FROM tbl ORDER BY i DESC LIMIT 3;', 'SEL * FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (a, b);', 'SEL #1, #3 FROM tbl;', 'SEL DISTINCT city FROM addresses;', 'SEL d FROM (SEL 1 AS a, 2 AS b) d;', 'SEL rowid, id, content FROM t;']
   `WHERE`: The WHERE clause specifies filters to apply to the data being queried, allowing selection of a specific subset of data. It is logically applied immediately after the FROM clause in a SQL query., Examples: ['SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = 3;', "SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name ILIKE '%mark%';", 'SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = 3 OR id = 7;'
   `ORDER BY`: The ORDER BY clause is an output modifier used to sort the rows in a query result set according to specified sorting criteria. It allows sorting in either ascending or descending order, and can also specify the position of NULL values (either at the beginning or end). The clause can contain multiple expressions that determine the sort order, and supports the sorting of columns by name, column position number, or the ALL keyword, which sorts by all columns in left-to-right order., Examples: ['SELECT * FROM addresses ORDER BY city;', 'SELECT * FROM addresses ORDER BY city DESC NULLS LAST;', 'SELECT * FROM addresses ORDER BY city, zip;', 'SELECT * FROM addresses ORDER BY city COLLATE DE;', 'SELECT * FROM addresses ORDER BY ALL;', 'SELECT * FROM addresses ORDER BY ALL DESC;']
   `GROUP BY`: The `GROUP BY` clause is used to specify which columns should be used for grouping when performing aggregations in a `SELECT` statement. It aggregates data based on matching data in the specified columns, allowing other columns to be combined using aggregate functions. The query becomes an aggregate query if a `GROUP BY` clause is specified, even if no aggregates are present in the `SELECT` clause., Examples: ['SELECT city, count(*) FROM addresses GROUP BY city;', 'SELECT city, street_name, avg(income) FROM addresses GROUP BY city, street_name;', 'SELECT city, street_name FROM addresses GROUP BY ALL;', 'SELECT city, street_name, avg(income) FROM addresses GROUP BY ALL;']
   `JOIN`: The FROM clause specifies the source of the data for the query. It can include a single table, multiple joined tables, or subqueries. The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins, including INNER, OUTER, CROSS, NATURAL, SEMI, ANTI, LATERAL, POSITIONAL, ASOF, and self-joins., Examples: ['SELECT * FROM table_name;', 'FROM table_name SELECT *;', 'FROM table_name;', 'SELECT tn.* FROM table_name tn;', 'SELECT * FROM schema_name.table_name;', 'SELECT t.i FROM range(100) AS t(i);', "SELECT * FROM 'test.csv';", 'SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM table_name);', 'SELECT t FROM t;', "SELECT t FROM (SELECT unnest(generate_series(41, 43)) AS x, 'hello' AS y) t;", 'SELECT * FROM table_name JOIN other_table ON table_name.key = other_table.key;', 'SELECT * FROM table_name TABLESAMPLE 10%;', 'SELECT * FROM table_name TABLESAMPLE 10 ROWS;', 'FROM range(100) AS t(i) SELECT sum(t.i) WHERE i % 2 = 0;', 'SELECT a.*, b.* FROM a CROSS JOIN b;', 'SELECT a.*, b.* FROM a, b;', 'SELECT n.*, r.* FROM l_nations n JOIN l_regions r ON (n_regionkey = r_regionkey);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport NATURAL JOIN airport_names;', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport JOIN airport_names USING (iata);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport SEMI JOIN airport_names USING (iata);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport WHERE iata IN (SELECT iata FROM airport_names);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport ANTI JOIN airport_names USING (iata);', 'SELECT * FROM city_airport WHERE iata NOT IN (SELECT iata FROM airport_names WHERE iata IS NOT NULL);', 'SELECT * FROM range(3) t(i), LATERAL (SELECT i + 1) t2(j);', 'SELECT * FROM generate_series(0, 1) t(i), LATERAL (SELECT i + 10 UNION ALL SELECT i + 100) t2(j);', 'SELECT * FROM trades t ASOF JOIN prices p ON t.symbol = p.symbol AND t.when >= p.when;', 'SELECT * FROM trades t ASOF LEFT JOIN prices p ON t.symbol = p.symbol AND t.when >= p.when;', 'SELECT * FROM trades t ASOF JOIN prices p USING (symbol, "when");', 'SELECT t.symbol, t.when AS trade_when, p.when AS price_when, price FROM trades t ASOF LEFT JOIN prices p USING (symbol, "when");', 'SELECT * FROM t AS t t1 JOIN t t2 USING(x);', 'FROM tbl SELECT i, s;', 'FROM tbl;']
   `WITH`: The WITH clause in SQL is used to define common table expressions (CTEs), which are temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs simplify complex queries by breaking them into more manageable parts, and they can be recursive, allowing them to reference themselves. The WITH clause can include multiple CTEs, and DuckDB supports specifying whether a CTE should be materialized explicitly or not., Examples: ['WITH cte AS (SELECT 42 AS x) SELECT * FROM cte;', 'WITH cte1 AS (SELECT 42 AS i), cte2 AS (SELECT i * 100 AS x FROM cte1) SELECT * FROM cte2;', 'WITH t(x) AS (⟨complex_query⟩) SELECT * FROM t AS t1, t AS t2, t AS t3;', 'WITH t(x) AS MATERIALIZED (⟨complex_query⟩) SELECT * FROM t AS t1, t AS t2, t AS t3;', 'WITH RECURSIVE FibonacciNumbers (RecursionDepth, FibonacciNumber, NextNumber) AS (SELECT 0 AS RecursionDepth, 0 AS FibonacciNumber, 1 AS NextNumber UNION ALL SELECT fib.RecursionDepth + 1 AS RecursionDepth, fib.NextNumber AS FibonacciNumber, fib.FibonacciNumber + fib.NextNumber AS NextNumber FROM FibonacciNumbers fib WHERE fib.RecursionDepth + 1 < 10) SELECT fn.RecursionDepth AS FibonacciNumberIndex, fn.FibonacciNumber FROM FibonacciNumbers fn;']
   `TOP`: The TOP clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query. The OFFSET clause specifies the starting point within the result set from which to begin returning rows. LIMIT is commonly used to return a specified number of rows from a result set, while OFFSET is used to skip a specified number of rows before beginning to return rows., Examples: ['SELECT * FROM addresses LIMIT 5;', 'SELECT * FROM addresses LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;', 'SELECT city, count(*) AS population FROM addresses GROUP BY city ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 5;']
   `CASE`: The CASE statement performs a conditional evaluation of expressions and returns a result based on a set of conditions. It functions similarly to a switch or ternary operation in other programming languages. It can handle multiple conditions using WHEN clauses, with an optional ELSE clause for unmatched conditions. If the ELSE clause is omitted and no conditions are met, the CASE statement returns NULL. The CASE statement can be used with individual conditions or with a single variable to switch based on predefined values., Examples: ['SELECT i, CASE WHEN i > 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS test FROM integers;', 'SELECT i, CASE WHEN i = 1 THEN 10 WHEN i = 2 THEN 20 ELSE 0 END AS test FROM integers;', 'SELECT i, CASE WHEN i = 1 THEN 10 END AS test FROM integers;', 'SELECT i, CASE i WHEN 1 THEN 10 WHEN 2 THEN 20 WHEN 3 THEN 30 END AS test FROM integers;']
   `CREATE TABLE`: The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in the catalog. It allows for the definition of columns, data types, constraints, and primary keys. Additionally, it supports features like creating temporary tables, using `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` for replicating schemas or importing data from CSV files, incorporating `OR REPLACE` to overwrite existing tables, using `IF NOT EXISTS` to conditionally create tables, and defining check and foreign key constraints., Examples: ['CREATE TABLE t1 (i INTEGER, j INTEGER);', 'CREATE TABLE t1 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, j VARCHAR);', 'CREATE TABLE t1 (id INTEGER, j VARCHAR, PRIMARY KEY (id, j));', 'CREATE TABLE t1 (\n    i INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    decimalnr DOUBLE CHECK (decimalnr < 10),\n    date DATE UNIQUE,\n    time TIMESTAMP\n);', 'CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT 42 AS i, 84 AS j;', "CREATE TEMP TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM read_csv('path/file.csv');", 'CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t1 (i INTEGER, j INTEGER);', 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t1 (i INTEGER, j INTEGER);', 'CREATE TABLE nums AS SELECT i FROM range(0, 3) t(i);', 'CREATE TABLE t1 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, percentage INTEGER CHECK (0 <= percentage AND percentage <= 100));', 'CREATE TABLE t1 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, j VARCHAR);\nCREATE TABLE t2 (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    t1_id INTEGER,\n    FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1 (id)\n);', 'CREATE TABLE t1 (x FLOAT, two_x AS (2 * x));']
   `DROP`: The `DROP` statement in DuckDB is used to remove a catalog entry that was previously added with the `CREATE` command. It can drop various types of objects such as tables, views, functions, indexes, schemas, sequences, macros, and types. It also has options like `IF EXISTS` to prevent errors if the object does not exist and `CASCADE` to also drop all dependent objects., Examples: ['DROP TABLE tbl;', 'DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v1;', 'DROP FUNCTION fn;', 'DROP INDEX idx;', 'DROP SCHEMA sch;', 'DROP SEQUENCE seq;', 'DROP MACRO mcr;', 'DROP MACRO TABLE mt;', 'DROP TYPE typ;', 'DROP SCHEMA myschema CASCADE;']
   `ALTER TABLE`: The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the schema of an existing table in the catalog. This includes adding, dropping, or modifying columns, renaming tables and columns, and setting or dropping default values and not null constraints. Changes made with `ALTER TABLE` are transactional, meaning they are not visible to other transactions until committed and can be rolled back., Examples: ['ALTER TABLE integers ADD COLUMN k INTEGER;', 'ALTER TABLE integers ADD COLUMN l INTEGER DEFAULT 10;', 'ALTER TABLE integers DROP k;', 'ALTER TABLE integers ALTER i TYPE VARCHAR;', "ALTER TABLE integers ALTER i SET DATA TYPE VARCHAR USING concat(i, '_', j);", 'ALTER TABLE integers ALTER COLUMN i SET DEFAULT 10;', 'ALTER TABLE integers ALTER COLUMN i DROP DEFAULT;', 'ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN x SET NOT NULL;', 'ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN x DROP NOT NULL;', 'ALTER TABLE integers RENAME TO integers_old;', 'ALTER TABLE integers RENAME i TO j;']
   `HAVING`: The HAVING clause is used after the GROUP BY clause in SQL to filter the grouped results. It performs filtering based on aggregate functions and conditions imposed on the grouped data. Unlike the WHERE clause, which filters rows before grouping, the HAVING clause filters after the grouping has been completed., Examples: ['SELECT city, count(*) FROM addresses GROUP BY city HAVING count(*) >= 50;', 'SELECT city, street_name, avg(income) FROM addresses GROUP BY city, street_name HAVING avg(income) > 2 * median(income);']
   `UPDATE`: The UPDATE statement modifies the values of rows in a table. It allows updating specific columns for rows that meet certain conditions, retaining previous values for unspecified columns. The statement can use data from other tables or the same table to determine the new values, using joins or subqueries., Examples: ['UPDATE tbl SET i = 0 WHERE i IS NULL;', 'UPDATE tbl SET i = 1, j = 2;', 'UPDATE original SET value = new.value FROM new WHERE original.key = new.key;', 'UPDATE original SET value = (SELECT new.value FROM new WHERE original.key = new.key);', "UPDATE original AS true_original SET value = (SELECT new.value || ' a change!' AS value FROM original AS new WHERE true_original.key = new.key);", "UPDATE city SET revenue = revenue + 100 FROM country WHERE city.country_code = country.code AND country.name = 'France';"]
   `DESCRIBE`: The DESCRIBE statement shows the schema of a table, view, or query. It can also be used to summarize a query by prepending DESCRIBE to a query., Examples: ['DESCRIBE tbl;', 'DESCRIBE SELECT * FROM tbl;']
   `USE`: The `USE` statement selects a database and optional schema to use as the default for future operations, such as when creating tables without a fully qualified name., Examples: ['USE memory;', 'USE duck.main;']
   `INSERT`: The INSERT statement is used to insert new data into a table in DuckDB. It can insert specific values, results from a query, handle conflicts with ON CONFLICT clauses, and return inserted rows using the RETURNING clause., Examples: ['INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (1), (2), (3);', 'INSERT INTO tbl SELECT * FROM other_tbl;', 'INSERT INTO tbl (i) VALUES (1), (2), (3);', 'INSERT INTO tbl (i) VALUES (1), (DEFAULT), (3);', 'INSERT OR IGNORE INTO tbl (i) VALUES (1);', 'INSERT OR REPLACE INTO tbl (i) VALUES (1);', 'INSERT INTO tbl BY POSITION VALUES (5, 42);', 'INSERT INTO tbl BY NAME (SELECT 42 AS b, 32 AS a);', 'INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (1, 84) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;', 'INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (1, 84) ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET j = EXCLUDED.j;', 'INSERT INTO tbl (j, i) VALUES (168, 1) ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET j = EXCLUDED.j;', 'INSERT INTO tbl BY NAME (SELECT 84 AS j, 1 AS i) ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET j = EXCLUDED.j;', 'INSERT INTO t1 SELECT 42 RETURNING *;', 'INSERT INTO t2 SELECT 2 AS i, 3 AS j RETURNING *, i * j AS i_times_j;', "CREATE TABLE t3 (i INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, j INTEGER); CREATE SEQUENCE 't3_key'; INSERT INTO t3 SELECT nextval('t3_key') AS i, 42 AS j UNION ALL SELECT nextval('t3_key') AS i, 43 AS j RETURNING *;"]
   `DELETE`: The `DELETE` statement removes rows from a table identified by the table-name. If no `WHERE` clause is specified, all rows are deleted. If a `WHERE` clause is provided, only rows matching the condition are deleted. The `USING` clause allows for deletion based on conditions involving other tables or subqueries., Examples: ['DELETE FROM tbl WHERE i = 2;', 'DELETE FROM tbl;', 'TRUNCATE tbl;']
   `CREATE VIEW`: The `CREATE VIEW` statement defines a new view in the catalog, allowing a query to be abstracted as a virtual table. It runs the specified query every time the view is referenced, without physically storing the results. The view can be created in a specified schema or the current one if no schema is mentioned., Examples: ['CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM tbl;', 'CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1 AS SELECT 42;', 'CREATE VIEW v1(a) AS SELECT 42;']
   `VALUES`: The VALUES clause is used to specify a fixed number of rows. It can be utilized as a stand-alone statement, as part of the FROM clause, or as input to an INSERT INTO statement., Examples: ["VALUES ('Amsterdam', 1), ('London', 2);", "SELECT * FROM (VALUES ('Amsterdam', 1), ('London', 2)) cities(name, id);", "INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('Amsterdam', 1), ('London', 2);", "CREATE TABLE cities AS SELECT * FROM (VALUES ('Amsterdam', 1), ('London', 2)) cities(name, id);"]

   Common Teradata Types:
   `VARCHAR`: `VARCHAR` is a versatile data type used to store variable-length character strings, accommodating a wide range of text and string data without enforcing a specific length., Examples: ['CREATE TABLE people (name VARCHAR, age INTEGER);', "INSERT INTO documents (text) VALUES ('This is a VARCHAR example text.');", "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';", 'ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR;', "UPDATE orders SET status = 'Shipped' WHERE order_id = 102;", "COPY products TO 'products.csv' DELIMITER ',' HEADER;"]
   `INTEGER`: The INTEGER data type, with aliases such as int, signed, int4, int32, integer, and integral, represents whole numbers and is commonly used to store numeric data without fractional components., Examples: ['-- Assigning integer values to columns in a CREATE TABLE statement\nCREATE TABLE my_table (id INTEGER, age INTEGER);', '-- Inserting integer values as literals within an INSERT statement\nINSERT INTO my_table VALUES (1, 25);', '-- Using integer operations in a SELECT statement\nSELECT id + 10 AS new_id FROM my_table;', '-- Casting a float to an integer\nSELECT CAST(3.7 AS INTEGER) AS whole_number;', '-- Defining a column to only accept non-negative integers using a CHECK constraint\nCREATE TABLE my_table (id INTEGER CHECK (id >= 0));', '-- Using the INTEGER type in a primary key definition\nCREATE TABLE users (user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR);', '-- Updating integer columns\nUPDATE my_table SET age = age + 1 WHERE id = 1;', '-- Comparing integer values in a WHERE clause\nSELECT * FROM my_table WHERE age > 20;']
   `NULL`: The `NULL` type in SQL represents a missing or unknown value, allowing for fields within a table to be uninitialized or absent in data., Examples: ['SELECT NULL = NULL;', 'SELECT NULL IS NULL;', "INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (NULL, 'data');", "SELECT coalesce(NULL, 'default_value');", 'UPDATE table_name SET column1 = NULL WHERE condition;', "SELECT CASE WHEN column IS NULL THEN 'Value is NULL' ELSE column END FROM table_name;"]
   `DATE`: The `DATE` type in SQL is used to store calendar dates without time components, representing a year, month, and day as accurate information for querying and managing date-related data., Examples: ["-- Add 5 days to a specific date\\nSELECT DATE '1992-03-22' + 5; -- Result: 1992-03-27\\n", "-- Subtract one date from another to get the number of days between them\\nSELECT DATE '1992-03-27' - DATE '1992-03-22'; -- Result: 5\\n", '-- Get the current date at the start of the transaction\\nSELECT current_date; -- Example result: 2022-10-08\\n', "-- Add an interval of 2 months to a specific date\\nSELECT date_add(DATE '1992-09-15', INTERVAL 2 MONTH); -- Result: 1992-11-15\\n", "-- Find the difference in months between two dates\\nSELECT date_diff('month', DATE '1992-09-15', DATE '1992-11-14'); -- Result: 2\\n", "-- Extract the year from a specific date\\nSELECT date_part('year', DATE '1992-09-20'); -- Result: 1992\\n", "-- Get the (English) name of the weekday from a specific date\\nSELECT dayname(DATE '1992-09-20'); -- Result: Sunday\\n", "-- Convert a date to a string format\\nSELECT strftime(date '1992-01-01', '%a, %-d %B %Y'); -- Result: Wed, 1 January 1992"]
   `TIME`: The `TIME` type represents a time of day, independent of a specific date, and is used to store and manipulate values consisting of hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds., Examples: ["SELECT TIME '14:21:13';", "SELECT TIME '08:30:00' + INTERVAL 5 MINUTE;", "SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIME '23:45:12');", 'SELECT MAKE_TIME(13, 30, 59.999);', 'SELECT CURRENT_TIME;']
   `TIMESTAMP`: A TIMESTAMP value represents an instant in time, composed of a combination of a date (year, month, day) and a time (hour, minute, second, microsecond), stored with microsecond precision, and it can be manipulated using various functions and operators., Examples: ["SELECT TIMESTAMP '1992-09-20 11:30:00.123456';", "SELECT TIMESTAMP '1992-09-20 11:30:00' + INTERVAL 10 DAYS;", "SELECT TIMESTAMP '2023-07-18 17:45:00' - TIMESTAMP '2023-07-10 15:30:00';", "SELECT age(TIMESTAMP '2023-07-18 17:45:00', TIMESTAMP '2022-07-18 17:45:00');", "SELECT strftime(TIMESTAMP '2023-07-18 17:45:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S');", "SELECT extract('hour' FROM TIMESTAMP '2023-07-18 17:45:00');"]
   `DECIMAL`: The DECIMAL data type, also known as NUMERIC or DEC, allows for the representation of exact fixed-point decimal numbers, providing precise control over the number of digits and the digits after the decimal point., Examples: ['CREATE TABLE salaries (\\n    employee_id INTEGER,\\n    base_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\\n);', 'INSERT INTO salaries (employee_id, base_salary) VALUES\\n    (1, 50000.00),\\n    (2, 65000.50);', 'SELECT employee_id, base_salary\\nFROM salaries\\nWHERE base_salary > DECIMAL(60000, 2);', 'UPDATE salaries\\nSET base_salary = base_salary + DECIMAL(5000.00, 2)\\nWHERE employee_id = 1;', 'SELECT CAST(99 AS DECIMAL(10, 2));']
   `ARRAY`: The ARRAY data type stores fixed-size arrays where each element is of the same type, and it is suitable for representing ordered sequences of elements such as numerical vectors or nested arrays., Examples: ['SELECT array_value(1, 2, 3); -- Creates an array with elements 1, 2, and 3', 'CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER, arr INTEGER[3]); -- Declares an array of three integers', 'SELECT id, arr[1] AS element FROM example_table; -- Retrieves the first element of the array', 'SELECT array_value(array_value(1, 2), array_value(3, 4), array_value(5, 6)); -- Creates a nested array using arrays as elements', 'INSERT INTO example_table VALUES (1, [1, 2, 3]), (2, [4, 5, 6]); -- Inserts rows with array values into a table', 'SELECT array_cosine_similarity(array_value(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), array_value(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)); -- Computes cosine similarity between two arrays of the same size', 'SELECT array_cross_product(array_value(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), array_value(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)); -- Computes the cross product of two 3-element arrays']
   `FLOAT`: The FLOAT data type, also known by aliases FLOAT4, REAL, or float, represents a single precision floating-point number, facilitating approximate calculations and efficient handling of numerical data with precision typically up to 6 decimal digits and a range of at least 1E-37 to 1E+37., Examples: ['-- Example: Creating a table with a FLOAT column\nCREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER, value FLOAT);', '-- Example: Inserting values into a FLOAT column\nINSERT INTO example_table VALUES (1, 3.14), (2, 2.718);', '-- Example: Performing arithmetic operations with FLOAT values\nSELECT id, value * 2.0::FLOAT AS doubled_value FROM example_table;', '-- Example: Casting a numeric value to FLOAT\nSELECT CAST(100 AS FLOAT) AS float_value;', '-- Example: Using FLOAT values in a mathematical function\nSELECT SQRT(value) FROM example_table WHERE value > 0;', '-- Example: Comparing FLOAT values\nSELECT * FROM example_table WHERE value > 3.0::FLOAT;']
   `BIGINT`: The `BIGINT` data type is an 8-byte integer that can store large integer values suitable for handling significant quantities or high precision integer data., Examples: ['CREATE TABLE example_table (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, count BIGINT, reference_id BIGINT);', "SELECT * FROM parquet_metadata('file.parquet') WHERE row_group_id = 1;", 'ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN order_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0;', 'UPDATE employee SET salary = salary + 1000 WHERE employee_id = 1001;', 'SELECT store_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales FROM transactions GROUP BY store_id;', 'CREATE SEQUENCE order_sequence START WITH 1000 INCREMENT BY 1 MINVALUE 100 MAXVALUE 10000 NO CYCLE;']
   `DOUBLE`: The `DOUBLE` type, also known as `FLOAT8`, is a double-precision floating point number data type commonly used for storing large or precise decimal values in SQL queries., Examples: ['```sql\n-- Using DOUBLE to store and manipulate high-precision values\nCREATE TABLE sales_data (\n    transaction_id INTEGER,\n    sale_amount DOUBLE\n);\n\nINSERT INTO sales_data (transaction_id, sale_amount) VALUES (1, 1999.99);\nSELECT sale_amount * 1.05 AS total_after_tax FROM sales_data WHERE transaction_id = 1;\n```', '```sql\n-- Calculating the square root of a DOUBLE value\nSELECT sqrt(column_value) FROM my_table WHERE column_value > 0;\n```', '```sql\n-- Using DOUBLE in mathematical functions\nSELECT sin(column1), cos(column2) FROM my_numeric_table;\n```', '```sql\n-- Explicit casting of an INTEGER to DOUBLE for precision in arithmetic operations\nSELECT cast(my_integer_column AS DOUBLE) / 2 FROM my_table;\n```', '```sql\n-- Working with DOUBLE in spatial functions\nDOUBLE ST_Area (geometry)  -- Computes the area of a geometry, returning a DOUBLE value as the area\n```', "```sql\n-- Using the DOUBLE type in JSON processing\nSELECT json_extract(my_json_column, '$.key')::DOUBLE FROM my_json_table;\n```"]
   `UNION`: The UNION data type is a nested type that holds one of multiple distinct values with a "tag" to identify the active type and can contain multiple uniquely tagged members of various types, akin to C++ std::variant or Rust's Enum., Examples: ["```sql\nCREATE TABLE tbl1 (u UNION(num INTEGER, str VARCHAR));\nINSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES (1), ('two'), (union_value(str := 'three'));\n```", "```sql\nSELECT union_extract(u, 'str') AS str\nFROM tbl1;\n```", '```sql\nSELECT u.str\nFROM tbl1;\n```', '```sql\nSELECT union_tag(u) AS t\nFROM tbl1;\n```']
   `ENUM`: The Enum data type represents a dictionary encoding structure that enumerates all possible unique string values of a column, allowing for efficient storage and query execution by storing only numerical references to the strings., Examples: ["CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('sad', 'ok', 'happy');", 'CREATE TYPE birds AS ENUM (SELECT my_varchar FROM my_inputs);', 'CREATE TABLE person (name TEXT, current_mood mood);', "INSERT INTO person VALUES ('Pedro', 'happy'), ('Pagliacci', 'sad');", 'SELECT enum_range(NULL::mood) AS mood_values;', 'DROP TYPE mood;']
   `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`: `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` (or `TIMESTAMPTZ`) represents a point in time using a calendar date and time of day along with a time zone offset, allowing for time zone sensitive operations such as conversions and comparisons., Examples: ["SELECT TIMESTAMPTZ '2023-10-17 12:00:00+01';", "SELECT now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC';", "SELECT TIMESTAMP '2023-10-17 10:00:00-07' AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York';", "SELECT age(TIMESTAMPTZ '2005-10-17 12:00:00-07');", "SELECT TIMESTAMPTZ '2023-10-17 15:00:00+00' - TIMESTAMPTZ '2023-10-16 15:00:00+00';"]
   `SMALLINT`: The SMALLINT type, with aliases such as short, int2, smallint, and int16, represents a signed two-byte integer that can store whole numbers ranging from -32768 to 32767., Examples: ['CREATE TABLE test_table (id SMALLINT);', 'INSERT INTO test_table (id) VALUES (100);', 'SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE id BETWEEN -100 AND 100;', 'ALTER TABLE test_table ADD COLUMN new_column SMALLINT;', 'UPDATE test_table SET id = id + 1 WHERE id < 32767;']
   `BLOB`: The BLOB (Binary Large Object) type represents a variable-length binary data object, used for storing arbitrary binary data in the database, such as images or files, without any interpretation of its contents., Examples: ["-- Create a BLOB with a single byte\\nSELECT '\\xAA'::BLOB;\\n-- Result: \\xAA\\n\\n-- Create a BLOB with multiple bytes\\nSELECT '\\xAA\\xAB\\xAC'::BLOB;\\n-- Result: \\xAA\\xAB\\xAC\\n\\n-- Concatenate two BLOB values\\nSELECT '\\xAA'::BLOB || '\\xBB'::BLOB;\\n-- Result: \\xAABB\\n\\n-- Convert a BLOB to a hexadecimal string\\nSELECT hex('\\xAA\\xBB'::BLOB);\\n-- Result: AABB\\n\\n-- Decode a BLOB to a string, ensuring it is valid UTF-8\\nSELECT decode('\\xC3\\xBC'::BLOB);\\n-- Result: ü\\n\\n-- Read a BLOB from a file\\nSELECT read_blob('myfile.bin');\\n-- Result: Contents of 'myfile.bin' as a BLOB"]

   Common Teradata Keywords:
   `AS`: The `AS` keyword in SQL is used to create an alias for columns or tables, helping to simplify query logic and improve readability., Examples: ['SELECT first_name AS name FROM employees;', 'SELECT department AS dept FROM company;', 'CREATE VIEW sales_report AS SELECT * FROM sales WHERE year = 2023;', 'SELECT product_name AS name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales FROM store GROUP BY product_name;', 'SELECT c.customer_id, c.name AS customer_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount AS amount FROM customers c INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;']
   `DISTINCT`: The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in the SQL `SELECT` statement to ensure that only unique values are returned for specified columns, effectively removing duplicate rows from the result set., Examples: ['SELECT DISTINCT city FROM addresses;', 'SELECT DISTINCT ON(country) city, population FROM cities ORDER BY population DESC;']
   `IN`: The `IN` keyword is used in SQL to specify a list of discrete values for a column to match against, typically in a `WHERE` clause, allowing for multiple specific conditions to be evaluated at once., Examples: ["SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Engineering', 'Marketing');", 'SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE grade IN (10, 11, 12);', "DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_status IN ('Cancelled', 'Returned');", "UPDATE items SET status = 'Unavailable' WHERE item_id IN (1001, 1002, 1003);", "SELECT * FROM logs WHERE severity IN ('ERROR', 'CRITICAL') ORDER BY timestamp DESC;"]
   `ALL`: The `ALL` keyword in SQL specifies that operations should retain all duplicate rows, as seen in commands like `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT ALL`, and `EXCEPT ALL`, which follow bag semantics instead of eliminating duplicates., Examples: ['UNION ALL\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM range(2) t1(x)\nUNION ALL\nSELECT * FROM range(3) t2(x);\n```\nThis example demonstrates using `UNION ALL` to combine rows from two queries without eliminating duplicates.', 'INTERSECT ALL\n\n```sql\nSELECT unnest([5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8]) AS x\nINTERSECT ALL\nSELECT unnest([5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9]);\n```\nThis example shows using `INTERSECT ALL` to select rows that are present in both result sets, keeping duplicate values.', 'EXCEPT ALL\n\n```sql\nSELECT unnest([5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8]) AS x\nEXCEPT ALL\nSELECT unnest([5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9]);\n```\nThis example illustrates `EXCEPT ALL`, which selects all rows present in the first query but not in the second, without removing duplicates.', 'ORDER BY ALL\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM addresses\nORDER BY ALL;\n```\nThis SQL command uses `ORDER BY ALL` to sort the result set by all columns sequentially from left to right.']
   `LIKE`: The `LIKE` expression is used to determine if a string matches a specified pattern, allowing wildcard characters such as `_` to represent any single character and `%` to match any sequence of characters., Examples: ["SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'abc'; -- true", "SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'a%'; -- true", "SELECT 'abc' LIKE '_b_'; -- true", "SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'c'; -- false", "SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'c%'; -- false", "SELECT 'abc' LIKE '%c'; -- true", "SELECT 'abc' NOT LIKE '%c'; -- false", "SELECT 'abc' ILIKE '%C'; -- true"]

  type: prompt
  description: "Test all the DBA MCP tools."
  prompt: |
    You are a Tester who is an expert in testing the functionality of tools in the dba module. You will test all tools in the module.
    ## your role will work through the phases
    Perform the phases in order, and do not skip any phase.
    
    ## Phase 0 - set up test environment 
    - what is your default database?
    - Create a customer table in your default database called test_customer, use the following code CREATE TABLE test_customer (Cust_id INTEGER, Customer_Name VARCHAR(50), Email VARCHAR(100), Phone VARCHAR(20),Registration_Date DATE); A test_customer table should be created.
    - Add 10 rows to the test_customer table. use the following script:`
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 'john.smith@email.com', '555-0101', DATE '2024-01-15');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane.doe@email.com', '555-0102', DATE '2024-02-20');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (3, 'Bob Johnson', 'bob.johnson@email.com', '555-0103', DATE '2024-03-10');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (4, 'Alice Brown', 'alice.brown@email.com', '555-0104', DATE '2024-04-05');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (5, 'Charlie Wilson', 'charlie.wilson@email.com', '555-0105', DATE '2024-05-12');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (6, 'Diana Davis', 'diana.davis@email.com', '555-0106', DATE '2024-06-18');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (7, 'Edward Miller', 'edward.miller@email.com', '555-0107', DATE '2024-07-22');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (8, 'Fiona Garcia', 'fiona.garcia@email.com', '555-0108', DATE '2024-08-03');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (9, 'George Lee', 'george.lee@email.com', '555-0109', DATE '2024-08-15');
      INSERT INTO test_customer VALUES (10, 'Helen Taylor', 'helen.taylor@email.com', '555-0110', DATE '2024-08-25');`

    ## Phase 1 - Get a list of all the SQL executed by a user
    - what is your user name?
    - test the query tool by running a query on the test_customer table. Use the base_readQuery function to run the query. The query should return the 10 rows you added in the previous phase, if no data is returned then fail this test.
    - test the query tool by running a query on the test_customer table with a filter. Use the base_readQuery function to run the query. The query should return only the rows that match the filter, if no data is returned then fail this test. (example of a filter is Cust_id > 5)
    - Get a list of all the SQL executed by your user name (e.g. demo_user) in the last 7 days using the dba_userSqlList tool. A list of all SQL statements should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test
    
    ## Phase 2 - Get a list of all the SQL executed against a table
    - Get a list of all the SQL executed against a table (e.g. test_customer) in the last 7 days using the dba_tableSqlList tool. A list of all SQL statements should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test

    ## Phase 3 - get a list of the current perm table space for a tables
    - Get the current perm table space for a test_customer table using the dba_tableSpace tool. The current perm table space should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 4 - get a list of the current perm database space for a database
    - Get the current perm database space for your default database (e.g. demo_user) using the dba_databaseSpace tool. The current perm database space should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 5 - get a list of the current database version
    - Get the current database version using the dba_databaseVersion tool. The current database version should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test. 

    ## Phase 6 - get a list of the system usage summary metrics
    - Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by weekday and hour for each workload type and query complexity bucket using the dba_resusageSummary tool. The system usage summary metrics should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test  

    ## Phase 7 - get a list of the system usage for a user
    - Get the system usage for your user name (e.g. demo_user) using the dba_resusageSummary tool. The system resusage for the user (e.g. demo_user) should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 8 - get a list of the system flow control metrics
    - Get the Teradata system flow control metrics by day and hour using the dba_flowControl tool. The system flow control metrics should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 9 - get a list of the user feature usage metrics
    - Get the user feature usage metrics using the dba_featureUsage tool. The user feature usage metrics should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 10 - get a list of the user delay metrics
    - Get the Teradata user delay metrics using the dba_userDelay tool. The user delay metrics should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 11 - get a list of the table usage impact by a user
    - Get the usage of a table test_customer by your user name (e.g. demo_user) using the dba_tableUsageImpact tool. The usage of the table by the user should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 12 - get a list of the session information for a user
    - Get the session information for your user name (e.g. demo_user) using the dba_sessionInfo tool. The session information for the user should be returned, if no data is returned then fail this test.

    ## Phase 13 - Clean up
    - Drop the test_customer table. Use the base_writeQuery function to drop the table. The tool should return a success message.
    ## Communication guidelines:
          - Be concise but informative in your explanations
          - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
          - summarize the success or any failure of the phase before moving to the next phase
    ## Final output guidelines:
          - return in markdown results for all phases as a table including the phase number, description, success or failure status, and a description of the outcome.
          - if a tool does not return any results, then fail that test and indicate it in the outcome.
    ## Example output:

          | Phase | Description | Status | Outcome |
          |-------|-------------|--------|---------|
          | 1     | Get a list of all the SQL executed against a table (e.g. test_customer) in the last 7 days | Successful |  |
          | 2     | Get the current perm table space for a test_customer table | Successful |  |
          | 3     | Get the current perm database space for a database (e.g. demo_user) | Successful |  |

  description: "The following prompt is used to guide the Teradata DBA in finding opportunities for archiving data."
  prompt: |
    You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in finding opportunities for archiving data.

    ## your role will work through the phases
    
    ## Phase 1. 
    Get a list of the 10 largest tables in the Teradata system using dba_tableSpace tool, ignore tables that: 
    - start with hist_ 
    - called All
    - are in the DBC database

    ## Phase 2.
    For each table starting with the largest table and work to the smallest table, you will:
    1. Get the DDL for the table using the base_tableDDL tool
    2. Determine the best strategy for archiving the older data only
    3. Write a Teradata SQL archiving statement to perform a insert select into a table named with the prefix of hist_

    ## Phase 3
    Bring the archiving statements together into a single script.
    
    ## Communication guidelines:
        - Be concise but informative in your explanations
        - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
        - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

    ## Final output guidelines:
        - will be a SQL script only

  type: prompt
  description: "You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in finding the lineage of tables in a database."
  prompt: |
    You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in finding the lineage of tables in a database.

    ## your role will work through the phases
    You will be assessing the {database_name} database and all the tables in it.

    ## Phase 1 - Get a list of tables in the database
    Get a list of tables in the Teradata system using base_tableList tool, ignore tables that: 
    - called All

    ## Phase 1 - Collect SQL for the table
    Cycle through the list of tables, following the following two steps in order
    Step 1. Get all the SQL that has executed against the table in the last {number_days} days using the dba_tableSqlList tool
    Step 2. Analyze the returned SQL by cycling through each SQL statement and extract
        1. Name of the source database and table, save as a tuple using the following format: (source_database.source_table, tardatabase.tartable)
        2. Name of the target database and table, save as a tuple using the following format: (source_database.source_table, tardatabase.tartable)

    ## Phase 3 - Create a distinct list 
    1. Review the tuples and create a destinct list of tuples, remove duplicates tuples

    ## Phase 4 - return results
    - return the list of tuples only.

    ## Communication guidelines:
        - Be concise but informative in your explanations
        - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
        - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

    ## Final output guidelines:
        - return the list of tuples only.
        - do not return any explanation of results

dba_tableDropImpact:
  type: prompt
  description: "You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in finding the impact of dropping a table."
  prompt: |

    You will be assessing the {table_name} table in {database_name} database and all the SQL that has executed against it.

    ## Phase 1 - Get usage data
    Get a list of sql that has executed against the table in the last {number_days} days using the dba_tableSqlList tool
    Save this list for use in Phase 2 - you will need to reference each SQL statement in it.
    
    ## Phase 2 - Analyze Usage data
    Using the SQL list collected in Phase 1:
    1. Create two dictionaries:
       - user_counts: to track usernames and their usage counts
       - table_deps: to track dependent tables and their reference counts
    2. For each SQL statement in the list:
       - Extract and count the username who executed it
       - Identify and count any tables that depend on our target table
    3. Keep these counts for use in Phase 3

    ## Phase 3 - Create a distinct list
    Using the user_counts and table_deps dictionaries from Phase 2:
    1. Create a sorted list of unique entries combining:
       - All usernames from user_counts (with their counts)
       - All dependent table names from table_deps (with their counts)

    ## Phase 4 - return results
    - return the list of usernames and tablenames only.

    ## Communication guidelines:
        - Be concise but informative in your explanations
        - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
        - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

    ## Final output guidelines:
        - Return a markdown table with the following columns:
            | Type | Name | Usage Count |
            |------|------|-------------|
            | User | username1 | count |
            | Table | tablename1 | count |
        - Sort the results by Usage Count in descending order
        - Include both users and dependent tables, with Type column indicating which is which
        - Do not include any additional explanation of results
